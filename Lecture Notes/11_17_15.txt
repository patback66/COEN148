Radiocity
	-The images that result have a softer shadow
	-Color Bleeding
		-Reflection of light energy in an environment prodces a phenomenon known as "color bleeding," where a brightly colored surface's color will "bleed" onto adjacent surfaces
		-Thermal radiation
	- E=hf -> max planck law -> single photon
		E = planck's constant * frequency
			- h = 6.2e-34 Joules/sec. for all photon
			E = sum(hf) all photons
	-Radiant flux
		-Radiosity: the rate of energy leaving the surface
		B=d(phi)/dA ->per unit area
		I = intensity, phi in some direction
		B = pi * I
	Radiosity illumination model
		-Light - direct from source, reflected from surface (reflected light energy)
		Pillum = direct light from light + indirect light from other surfaces
		surface K is either emitter (light source) or emitter/reflector
	Radiosity
		Bk = Ek + PkHk
			Ek for non-light, Ek=0
			Hk = sum(Bj * Fj->k, j=1, n) depends on the form factor ->percentage of radiant energy of surface j that can reach surface k

		Bk = Ek + Pk*sum(BjFj->k, j-1, n)

		Bk - sum(BjFjk, j=1, n) = Ek
		Bk - PkBkFkk - Pk*sum()
		(1-PkFkk)Bk - Pk * sum(BjFjk, j!=k, n) = Ex

		Calculate form factor
		Nusselt-analog
			Fjk = A/B
