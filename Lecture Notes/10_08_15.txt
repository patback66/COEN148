Next time: 3D Clipping

Text Clipping
-3 Scales
	-Keep whole string
	-Keep whole Char
	-Pixel scale/clip

3D Viewing
	-Model Coordinates
		-Local Cooordinates
	-Put into scene (world) coordinates
	-Normalize the coordinates
	-Translate to viewing cooordinates
	-Now project onto a 2d projection plane
		-projection is all mathematics
	-Now fit into clipping window
	-View volume
		-In between far clipping plane and near clipping plane
	-Put into screen coordinates - the viewport
