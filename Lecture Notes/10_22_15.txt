Particle System
Rasterization
Hidden Surface Removal (Visible Surface Detection)

Particle System
	-Phrase used loosly
		-Could mean
			-modeling technique
			-animation technique
			-rendering technique
	-Common cirteria
		-collection of particles
		-random attributes
	-Modeling fuzzy objects - several advantages
		-particle simpler to represent
		-model definition is procedural, controlled by random numbers. Obtaining a highly detailed model is much easier
	-To compute each from:
		-New particles are generated into the system
		-Each new particle is assigned its individual attributes
		-Any particles that have existed wihtin the system past their prescribed lifetime are extinguished
		-Remaining particles are moved and transformed according to their dynamic attributes
		-An image of the living particles is rendered in a frame buffer
	-Also issues of collision detection. Like particles bounce off a wall or each other
	-Trees may be modeled using a particle system

Rasterization
	-Part of the graphics pipeline
	-Rasterization: process of actually generating pixels on screen by converting projected coordinates into pixels
		-Rasterization - make fragments (pixels) from clipped objects
		-clipping - clip objects to viewing volume
		-hidden surface removal - determine visible fragments
