The idea behind creating 3D images on screen: Projection
	CENTRAL CONCEPT

The final image is always 2d, but this image is created from 3D information

CRT
	low persistence - need high refresh, good for animation
	high persistence - low refresh, good for static information
	resolution - max number of points

	Types

		Raster-scan
			electron beam is swept across screen, one row at a time
			goes through all points - either turned on or off
			each point is acalled a "pixel"
			picture definition is stored in memory area called frame buffer (refresh buffer)
				For b/w image, 1bit/pixel is enough so bitmap
				For color, 23bit/pixel (RGB, 8 bit for each of 3 colors) - pixmap
		
		Random-scan display (vector display)
			electron beam is directed only to those parts where picture is to be displayed
			like a pen plotter
			better for line drawing application, not for realistic shaded scenes
			resizing a vector drawing will not lose resolution
