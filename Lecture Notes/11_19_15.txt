Computer Animation

Animation
	-Persistence of vision
	-Human eye will retain an image it has seen for a brief moment
		-thaumatrope
		-when many images are passing the eye, the eye retains each one and the brain interprets as a continuous image
	-Zoetrope
	-Beta movement
	-Key frame vs in-between

Computer Animation
	-Tools - replace physical cel
	-Key-framed - program can produce in-between frames of key frames
	-Procedural - use mathematical/physical equations to calculate the positions of objects

Key-framed system:
	-use linear interpolation
	-automaically generate in betweens

Image Morphing
	-Image warping
		-change the pixel position (instead of the color)
		-Transform the pixel location using functions
	-Use geometric transformation
		-translation, scaling, rotation
	-Use Polynomial transformation
		-deformations	
	-How to find the mapping function?
		-select k corresponding points on two images
			-these points should be "points of interest" - corners of eyes, mouth corners, etc
		-determine the coefficients ai, bi, i = 0, ..., N-1 by solving
			-N is the order of the polynomial, so number of points K need to be enough to solve this equation, which means, K>=N

	Motion Path
		-Geometric transformation
		-Approximation: use some math functions

	Timing
		-model speed up

	Motion Capture
		-Similar to rotoscoping
	Double Buffering - for smooth animation
		-draw image to color buffer, screen is constantly updated from color buffer, if screen is updated before drawing is done, get flickery animation
	Live action + animation
		- use after effect to merge animation into live video
	Collision detection
