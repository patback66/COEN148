Texture Mapping

Techniques to add surface detail
	-2 Ways
		1) Add extra small polygons to create surface detail. This will increase scene complexity and thus slow down the rendering speed. Also some detail features are hard to model!
		2) Map a texture image to the surface. This is a more popular approach. The surface detail does not affext the geometry complexity.
	-The texture here could be different types of surface properties: color, normal, specular
	-Bitmpap (pixel map) image
		-This is a 2D image, represented by a 2D array: Texture[height][width][3] (rgb)
		-each pixel is located as (s,t) and is called a texel
			-(s,t) is normalized into [0,1] range
			-Specify map between texture coordinates to each corner of the polygon. Sometimes this process is done manually or automatically
	-Process
		-texture->object->screen image
	-Rasterization
	-How to map
		-linear mapping
		-intermediate map object (map shape)
	-Interpolation
	-Map Shape
		-to simplify the problem of mappiong from an image to an arbitrary model, we use an object we already have a map for as an intermediate object (map shape)
		-Texture -> intermediate -> object
		-Planar map: to look up texture for (xyz) on 3D object, throw away one coordinate, for example z, then use (x,y) to look up color in texture map
		-Sphere Map:
			(x,y,z) -> (latitude, longitude)
		-Cube Map
		-Texture coordinates need to move with object coordinates. Need to change the texture map if move the object
		-Texture can be used for more than color
			-Displacement mapping:
				-the texture is used to perturb the surface geommetry itself (animate the surface), geometry surface is modified
			-Bump mapping
				-simulating bumps and wrinkles on the surface of an object by perturbing the surface normals
