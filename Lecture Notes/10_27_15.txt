Illumination (lighting, shading)
	-Is a model to simulate lighting effect (shading effect) on object surface based on the physical laws
	-Shading Model, Lighting Model, Illumination Model
	-Used to calculate an illuminated position on the surface of an object
	-2 Deciding factors:
		-Surface properties: material, texture, transparency, reflection, color
		-Light source: position, color, intensity, type
	-Point Light - puts light in all directions
	-Parallel Light - direction, unlimited range
	-Spotlight - has direction and range - cone of light
	-Large light source - grid of directional point light
	-Rough surface - diffuse reflection (lambert reflection)
	-Smooth surface - specular reflection
	-Ambient Light / Backroung light - light reflected from surrounding objects
