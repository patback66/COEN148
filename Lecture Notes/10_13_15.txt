3D Clipping

Polygon Clipping
	-apply 2d clipping to edges

3D Object Representation
	-3 Ways to represent an object
		1) Boundary representation:
			describe the surface of the 3D object, the boundary of the object is like infinitesimally thin eggshell. Almost all visual models used in games and film are shell models
		2) Solid modeling
			ensure surfaces meet properly and that the object is geometrically correct. Cross-section can be rendered, used in CAD and medical applications
		3) Algorithmic Modeling
			Using function or rules to create object recursively

Boundary Representation
	-most commonly used method, is using polygon to represent the surface
	-triangeles are more used because a trinagle is a plane, and easier to calculate the normal (surface direction)
	-"Polygon mesh"
	-Data structure:
		-Using Vertex list
			-simple, but not widely used , because you have to figure out which vertices form a surface
		-Using face vertex list
			-more widely used, has information of every face, and vertices to face pointer
			Faces[ | | | | |], each Faces[i] holds a vertex list - 3 vertices each
		-Using face vertex edge list
			-easier to manipulatre mesh geometery
			-but large storage
			-vertex table, edge table, surface table

Equation-based (Second-degree quadratic equation)
